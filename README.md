### 👋 Hi, I'm Clinton Boyda

I'm a University graduate with a degree in both Psychology and Computing Science [aka Cognitive Science]. I have a keen interest exploring and building new solutions but most of my work is not publically available for download.

Specializations include: 
* ✅ Exploring and Implementing Technology Solutions for my client's success
* ✅ Analysis & Business visualizations to solve problems, discover trends and gain insights
* ✅ Product Development Building Software that Empowers Business Growth thru Automation
* ✅ Project Management Consulting, Research and Leading Cross-functional teams
* ✅ Mitigating Risks by planning and reducing impacts of disasters through ongoing community resilience

As a Professional Project Manager, I have recognized presentations + decisions based on data are critical to the iterative cycle of Agile development so I am continually using and improving my data analysis, data visualization and business intelligence skills.
