### üëã Hi, I'm Clinton Boyda

I'm a University of Alberta graduate with a degree in both Psychology and Computing Science [aka Cognitive Science]. I started in custom database development -> launched a SaaS CMS -> directed Emergency Management -> now focused on leveraging analytics for better data-driven decisions and automation!  My path started automating and storing data, now it is focused on helping interpret all this information.

Specializations include: 
* ‚úÖ Exploring and Implementing Technology Solutions for my client's success
* ‚úÖ Analysis & Business visualizations to solve problems, discover trends and gain insights
* ‚úÖ Product Development Building Software that Empowers Business Growth thru Automation
* ‚úÖ Project Management Consulting, Research and Leading Cross-functional teams
* ‚úÖ Mitigating Risks by planning and reducing the impacts of disasters through community resilience

I have a keen interest exploring and building new solutions with most of my previous work being confidenially delivered to clients (not publically available for download).  Lately, I have been focusing on data analysis, machine learning, and data visualizations to improve project delivery, presentations and assist decision-makers with better data-driven behaviour.
